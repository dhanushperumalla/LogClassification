# 🔍 Log Classification System 🔍

## 📋 Overview

This system provides automated classification of log entries using a multi-tiered approach. It combines regular expressions, machine learning, and large language models to accurately categorize logs based on their content and structure. 🤖

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend** 🖥️: A user interface for submitting logs, viewing classification results, and managing the system.
2. **Backend** ⚙️: The classification engine that processes logs and determines their categories.

## 🧠 Classification Approaches

The system employs a cascading approach to log classification:

1. **Regular Expression (Regex)** 📝:

   - Handles the most simplified and predictable patterns
   - Useful for patterns that are easily captured using predefined rules
   - Fast and efficient for well-structured logs ⚡

2. **Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression** 🔄:

   - Manages complex patterns when there is sufficient training data
   - Utilizes embeddings generated by Sentence Transformers
   - Applies Logistic Regression as the classification layer
   - Provides good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency 📊

3. **LLM (Large Language Models)** 🧠:
   - Used for handling complex patterns when sufficient labeled training data is not available
   - Provides a fallback approach when other methods fail
   - Offers high accuracy for ambiguous or previously unseen log formats 🎯

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Log Ingestion** 📥: The system receives log entries through the frontend interface or API.
2. **Preprocessing** 🧹: Logs are cleaned, normalized, and prepared for classification.
3. **Classification Pipeline** 🔄:
   - First, regex patterns attempt to match and classify the log
   - If unsuccessful, the Sentence Transformer + Logistic Regression model processes the log
   - If still uncertain, the LLM is used as a final classification method
4. **Result Presentation** 📊: Classification results are displayed to the user with confidence scores and explanations.
